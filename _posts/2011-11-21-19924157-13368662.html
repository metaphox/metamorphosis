有趣的问题。如果 <a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//old.iupac.org/standing/idcns/italic-roman_dec99.pdf" class=" external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><span class="invisible">http://</span><span class="visible">old.iupac.org/standing/</span><span class="invisible">idcns/italic-roman_dec99.pdf</span><span class="ellipsis"></span><i class="icon-external"></i></a>一文中所述属实，则：          <br><blockquote><u>The overall rule is that symbols representing physical quantities (or variables) are italic, but symbols representing units, or labels, are roman</u>.  Sometimes there may seem to be doubt as to whether a symbol represents a quantity or has some other meaning (such as a label): a good general rule is that quantities, or variables, can be given a value, but labels cannot.  Vectors, tensors and matrices are usually denoted using a bold-face (heavy) font, but they should still be italic since they are still quantities.        <br><i>Example</i>:  The mass of my pen <i>m</i>  =  24 g  =  0.024 kg.  The electric field strength <i><b>E</b></i> has components <i>Ex</i>, <i>Ey</i>, and <i>Ez</i>.  The Planck constant <i>h</i> = 6.626 068 76 (52)  ×10–34 J s.<br>The above rule applies equally to letter symbols from both the Greek and the Latin alphabet, <u>although authors often appear to resist putting Greek letters into italic</u>. <br><i>Example</i>:  when the symbol  <i>µ</i>  is used to denote a physical quantity (such as mass or reduced mass) it should be italic, but when it is used in a unit such as the microgram,  µg , or when it is used as the symbol for the muon,  µ  (see 5 below), it should be roman.<br><br>Numbers, and labels, are generally roman (upright), since they are not physical quantities.</blockquote><br> 所以也许高德纳就属于认为（大写）希腊字母不该是斜体的那一类？
