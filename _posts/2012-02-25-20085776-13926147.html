后面还有半句是 it may be that to a later era my significance will also depend a little on my writings。他认为同时代的人只在意自己的衣装却无视自己文学成就和伟大思想。<br><br>-<blockquote>Kierkegaard provoked an attack on himself by the journal <i>The Corsair</i>. The journal, edited by the talented Jewish author Meïr Goldschmidt, specialized in ruthless satirical attacks on contemporary Danish authors. Yet, perhaps because of the esteem in which Goldschmidt held him, Kierkegaard had been spared. Kierkegaard found this favorable treatment offensive (partly out of vanity, ostensibly because of his ongoing critique of the press’s influence on public opinion). So he publicly challenged <i>The Corsair</i> to do its worst. It did. It launched a series of attacks on Kierkegaard, more personal than literary, and focused on his odd appearance and his relationship with Regina. <b>In some wicked caricatures it portrayed him with one trouser leg shorter than the other</b>, with a sway back, and riding on a woman’s (Regina’s) back with stick in hand. These caricatures made a laughing stock of Kierkegaard in Copenhagen, to the extent that he was mocked in the street and had to give up his habit of walking around the inner city to talk with all and sundry.</blockquote>-<br><a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.iep.utm.edu/kierkega/" class=" external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><span class="invisible">http://www.</span><span class="visible">iep.utm.edu/kierkega/</span><span class="invisible"></span><i class="icon-external"></i></a> "e.
