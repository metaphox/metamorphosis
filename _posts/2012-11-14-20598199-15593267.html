<blockquote><b>Are Lithium Ion batteries available in standard sizes like AA , C or D cell size?</b><br>No, Lithium-ion batteries are not available in standard sizes. We believe this is because it would be too easy for users to inadvertently put them in a charger not designed for Lithium-ion batteries creating a potentially dangerous situation. (If an alkaline battery is put into the wrong charger it might leak or even burst, but a lithium-ion battery put into a NiCd or NiMH charger not designed for lithium-ion, might ignite. Also, because Li-ion batteries operate at much higher voltage (typically 3.7V per cell)  than the 1.2 to 1.5V of most cell batteries, designing a 1.5V lithium-ion cell would be expensive.</blockquote><a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.greenbatteries.com/libafa.html%23Li-ion%2520in%2520AA" class=" external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><span class="invisible">http://www.</span><span class="visible">greenbatteries.com/liba</span><span class="invisible">fa.html#Li-ion%20in%20AA</span><span class="ellipsis"></span><i class="icon-external"></i></a>
